# AI Researcher: A Multi-Agent System for Autonomous Scientific Research

**Author:** Oluwafemi Diakhoa

## Overview
The AI Researcher is a multi-agent system that automates various research tasks, from data collection and literature review to hypothesis generation and predictive modeling. It is built to streamline research workflows in domains that involve complex data analysis, such as climate science, medicine, and social sciences.

## Features
- **Data Retrieval and Preprocessing:** Automatic dataset download and cleanup.
- **Literature Review Generation:** Automated review synthesis using OpenAI.
- **Hypothesis Generation:** Data-driven hypothesis creation.
- **Experiment Design and Data Analysis:** Structured analysis and rolling statistics.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Trend forecasting using ARIMA and SARIMA models.
- **Documentation and Report Generation:** Auto-generated, publication-ready reports.

## Project Structure
- **notebooks/**: Main research notebook
- **src/**: Source code containing agent modules and utility functions
- **data/**: Directory for storing raw and processed datasets
- **tests/**: Contains test cases for different modules
