### 3. **Add Supporting Files**
- **.gitignore**: Include files and folders to ignore, such as:
  ```plaintext
  __pycache__/
  *.pyc
  .env
  data/raw/
  data/processed/
  ```
- **LICENSE**: Choose a license, like MIT or Apache, and include a `LICENSE` file.
- **.env.example**: List environment variables without actual values. This should include:
  ```plaintext
  OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
  KAGGLE_USERNAME=your_kaggle_username
  KAGGLE_KEY=your_kaggle_key
  ```

### 4. **Create CONTRIBUTING.md**
- Provide guidance on how others can contribute to the project.
- Outline the process for submitting issues, pull requests, and coding standards (e.g., PEP8 for Python).
- Explain any testing requirements (e.g., all code must pass `pytest` tests before merging).

**Sample CONTRIBUTING.md Template**:
```markdown
